<h1>Foundational Flexbox: Project</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> This repository is made as part of TOP (The Odin Project) requirements after completing the flexbox section within the foundational course. It is to create a homepage entirely from scratch using images they provided for us (<a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png">1</a> and <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png">2</a>) as blueprints or a guiding marker.</p>

<h3>Intentions</h3>
<p>I solidified my understandings in the basic flexbox properties because of the supplementary readings provided in the alignment section of the course specifically. I hope to compare my methodology of how I tackle building this website to how I used to in the past with other projects (like <a href="https://github.com/2305G6YE/recipe-card">my recipe card project</a> and <a href="https://github.com/2305G6YE/odin-recipes">my recipe pages project</a>). That would be a solid indicator to me that I learnt tangible skills I can use in the workforce.

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
