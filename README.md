<h1>Foundational Flexbox: Project</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> This repository is made as part of TOP (The Odin Project) requirements after completing the flexbox section within the foundational course. It is to create a homepage entirely from scratch using images they provided for us (<a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png">1</a> and <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png">2</a>) as blueprints or a guiding marker.</p>

<h3>Intentions</h3>
<p>I solidified my understandings in the basic flexbox properties because of the supplementary readings provided in the alignment section of the course specifically. I hope to compare my methodology of how I tackle building this website to how I used to in the past with other projects (like <a href="https://github.com/2305G6YE/recipe-card">my recipe card project</a> and <a href="https://github.com/2305G6YE/odin-recipes">my recipe pages project</a>). That would be a solid indicator to me that I learnt tangible skills I can use in the workforce.

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>The biggest help to me in this project is finding a way to display the flex-containers. I will likely be using some similar method when learning grid so I can visualize things easier. It was more difficult to arrange things using flexbox than I originally thought. However, i liked that I seemed to be able to imagine how the containers should be written in the HTML file easier compared to my previous projects. "Ah, this needs its own container, that needs to be aligned with this, or standing on its own" - that kind of troubleshooting mindset. I think the next few ideas I want to clear in my head is how to tweak alignment more smoothly if I wish to use padding. Granted, this was a mimicry project, so the font-weights and font-sizes are not crystal-perfect, but I am happy I attempted to make it perfect.</p>
